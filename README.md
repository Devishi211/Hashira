# Polynomial Regression in Java

## Overview

This project implements **Polynomial Regression** in Java. Polynomial regression is an extension of linear regression that models the relationship between the independent variable (**X**) and dependent variable (**Y**) as an nth-degree polynomial.

It can capture non-linear relationships in data, making it more flexible than simple linear regression.

##  Features

* Fits a polynomial regression model of a given degree.
* Uses **Least Squares Method** for coefficient estimation.
* Prints polynomial coefficients and predicted values.
* Can handle user-defined datasets.
* Easily extendable for different degrees of polynomial.

##  Technologies Used

* **Java** (Core Programming Language)
* **Matrix operations** implemented manually (no external libraries)

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the project in any Java IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, NetBeans) or use terminal.
3. Compile the code:

   ```bash
   javac PolynomialRegression.java
   ```
4. Run the code:

   ```bash
   java PolynomialRegression
   ```
5. The program will:

   * Display the **polynomial coefficients**.
   * Show predictions based on the model.
